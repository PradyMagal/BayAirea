# BayAirea

Welcome to Bay Airea, a simple, easy to use, yet effective Air Quality App for IOS, and Android!
## Why We made This

After the California fires, many were left dubious of the air quality, and wanted to know whether it was safe or not to go outside.
__
While there are many apps out there, they have some problems,<br />
-They have their hard to use scale
-They average out all of the particle densities into one measure, when in reality, all one needs to care about are 2.5 AQI particles(these are small enough to enter your lungs, and into your blood stream)
-They are "cluttered", yes, more information is always apreciated but when there are so many numbers and so much data that the its difficult to use the app for its intended purpose, then there's a real problem
<br />
We wanted to be the app that makes the difference for our local cities here, in the California Bay Area, by providing people with the air quality information they need, and none of the other stuff they don't.
##How We Made It
Using Google's amazing Java framework <a href="flutter.io">Flutter</a>, we were able to make a native app for both IOS and Android simultaneously. For the data itself, we used <a href="purpleair.org">PurpleAir</a>, a company which allows people to install air-quality sensors in their homes, and uses their wifi and electricity to add data to their network
