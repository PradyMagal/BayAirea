Welcome to Bay Airea, a simple, easy to use, yet effective Air Quality App for IOS, and Android!

## Purpose

After/during the California Camp Fires, many residents feared to leave the safety of their homes in the face of rapidly deteoriating air quality.

**While there are many apps out there, they have some problems:**

- Differing scales of measurement and readings provide misinformation.
- They average out all of the particle densities into their measurement, while 2.5 AQI particles are the only particle useful to the average user. (These are small enough to enter your lungs and blood stream)
- They are "cluttered", yes, more information is always apreciated but when there are so many numbers and so much data that the its difficult to use the app for its intended purpose, then there's a real problem


We wanted to be the app that makes the difference for our local cities here, in the California Bay Area, by providing people with the air quality information they need.



## How We Made It


Using Google's brand new amazing Java framework [Flutter](https://flutter.io/), we are able to make a native app for both IOS and Android simultaneously. 

For the data itself, we use [PurpleAir](https://www.purpleair.com/), a company which accesses data given by air quality sensors installed by ordinary citizens.
